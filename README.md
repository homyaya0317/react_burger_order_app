# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, and use browser tools to inspect. To view the app in a mobile view, right-click, choose "Inspect," and select the responsive mode (usually found in the top-left corner) of your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard structure created by Create React App, including:

- `src`: Contains the source code for the React app.
- `public`: Contains the public assets and the `index.html` file.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this structure based on your project requirements.

## Viewing in Responsive Mode

To test the app's responsiveness, you can use the responsive mode feature in your browser's developer tools. This is typically found in the top-left corner of the developer tools panel.
